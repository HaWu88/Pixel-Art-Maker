# Pixel Art Maker Project

## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

## How it works

* Using DOM to listen to 'submit' to make the grid for canvas based on user input
* Using DOM to listen to 'mousedown' to color the square on the canvas.
* Implemented .preventDefault( ) to stop opening new page upon clicking on button
